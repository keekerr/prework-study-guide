The Coding bootcamp Prework study guide performs two tasks. One is to assess the current technical capabilities of students and the other is to create an initial resource for students to rely on in this challening course. my moyiviation for this course is to better my career opportunities. I built thiss project to better understand the potential scope for this course. I have never coded before so this inital opportunity to walk through some material was very helpful. My biggest takeaway from this initial assignment was the developer mindset. I wasn't sure that I would be able to handle the challeng that coding entails but so far I have suprised myself with my ability to think on my feet and find a solution in a difficult situation.
